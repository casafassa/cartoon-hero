		<h2>About Judge Dredd</h2>
		<p>In the future, crime is so bad the law enforcement
		officers are also the judges, delivering swift sentences to the
		unending supply of violent criminals at the scene of their crimes. This is Judge Dredd. He is remorseless in
		his droconian dispatching of undesirable miscreants and delivers brutal justice
		upon the heads of wicked degenerates. We could use a Dredd right now, right
		here in 2019!</p>

		<p>Dredd's primary weapon, The Lawgiver, is replete with all manner of ordinance to take out scores of
		degenerate criminals unwilling to comply with his orders.</p>
